Tectonigrated runs when invoked with the command "rendermap" or runs automatically every so many minutes, specified by "runPeriodMins" in config.yml.
Backups of worlds can optionally be saved to a specified backup folder.

Setup instructions:
1. Place a Tectonicus jar file in the Tectonigrated folder.
2. Place a minecraft.jar file in the Teconigrated folder.
3. Configure config.yml. Examples can be found in config-examples.yml.
4. Configure tectonicus.xml. Sane defaults are in place, but your configuration will likely be much different.
